For no other reason than to make it work (and I love rainbows and unicorns) I decided to mimic the new Facebook apps menu.  In the new Facebook app (as of 9/17/12) you can swipe right when viewing a timeline to show a table underneath where you can select a different timeline, etc...  This app demonstrates that functionality using a container view controller with a couple of child view controllers (a table view controller for the rainbow and a uiviewcontroller for the detail).  It's only iOS 6 compatible.  Sorry guys!
